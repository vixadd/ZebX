## Installation

To install

```
python setup.py install
```

To use as the greeter, go to `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` and change the
`greeter-session` option to

```
greeter-session=kano-greeter
```


Alternatively, build the Debian package with

```
debuild -us -uc -b
```

And install by running

```
sudo dpkg -i <file_just_created>
```

# Developing

## Environment Setup

Copy `kano-greeter.desktop` to `/usr/share/xgreeters`

```
sudo cp config/kano-greeter.desktop /usr/share/xgreeters/kano-greeter-devel.desktop
```

Change the `Exec` parameter in it to the path to the executable (change the path
to the cloned repo to be just that)

```
sudo sed -i 's|^\(Exec\=\).*|\1'`pwd`'/bin/kano-greeter|' /usr/share/xgreeters/kano-greeter-devel.desktop
```

Copy the LightDM config file and change the greeter to be the development one

```
cp /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf lightdm-devel.conf
sudo sed -i 's|^\(greeter-session\=\).*|\1kano-greeter-devel|' lightdm-devel.conf
```

## Testing

The greeter can be run after installation, for testing, as a regular X
application with

```
lightdm --test-mode --debug --config=/path/to/lightdm-devel.conf
```

This will run as an unprivileged user and skip anything that requires root
permissions.
